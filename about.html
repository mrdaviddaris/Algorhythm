      <p><h2>My Story</h2></p><br>
      <p>I grew up in an alcoholic home and fear and insecurity plagued me until I discovered alcohol at age 16. I chased that feeling of invulnerability for the next seven years. Life was a blur until I got sober in the early nineties.</p><br>
      <p>My life was changed by the Twelve Steps and along the way I found my conception of God. He has transformed my life through living life one day at a time on His terms. Along the way I met my wife, another life-changer.</p>
      <p>God introduced me to a life of mindful intuition, best described on pages 86-87 of the <em>Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous</em>, which states:</p>
           <p><em>"In thinking about our day we may face indecision. We may not
          be able to determine which course of action to take. Here we ask
          God for inspiration, an intuitive thought or a decision. We relax
          and take it easy. We don't struggle. We are often suprised how the
          right answers come after we have tried this for a while. What used
          to be the hunch or the occsasional inspiration gradually becomes a
          working part of the mind. Being still inexperienced and having just
          made contact with God, it is not probable that we are going to be
          inspired at all times. We might pay for this presumption in all sorts
          of absurd actions and ideas. Nevertheless, we find that our thinking
          will, as time passes, be more and more on the plane of inspiration.
          We come to rely on it. (1935)"</em></p>
          <p>I am devoted to making things better around me, be they at home, work, or volunteering. I am obsessed with processes and am pained when they fail. I love to work and learn, spend time with my family, and be as healthy as I can be.</p>
          <p>I recently jumped full into web-development  and am mastering HTML and CSS. I just started ES6 and will push forward into Python when done. I am on my way and I look forward to learning with the next <strong>#VetsWhoCode</strong> Cohort.</p><br>
