      <p><h2>My Story</h2></p><br>
      <p>I grew up in an alcoholic home in the suburbs. The insanity in my house 
        got especially intense through my middle school and high school years. Fear 
        and insecurity were constant companions until I discovered alcohol at age 16. I chased
        the feeling of invulnerability that came with it for the next seven 
        years. In that time I joined the National Guard, went to college (which I thought
        would fix me), dropped out, and joined the active duty Army in 1990. I served with some
        great units but I wasn't a very good Soldier. From 1991-1993 I was stationed in Panama, Central
        America. It was great though trouble abounded in all the third world had to offer and I found it. 
        While I was never really all together in the first place, my limited life eroded away to nothing
        and I hit bottom soon after returning to the States in autumn of 1993. Immediately after hitting bottom
        I went to my first AA meeting.</p><br>
      <p>My life was changed by the Twelve Steps and, during the process, I began a relationship
          with my Higher Power, who I choose to call God. I started to live life with guidance
          from my friends in AA and a reliance upon God. People in recovery often state God speaks to them
          in a "still small voice." Pages 86-87 of the <em>Into Action</em> chapter of the <em>Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous</em>,
          describe what is very important in my life and is the foundation of
          logical intuition:</p>
           <p><em>"In thinking about our day we may face indecision. We may not
          be able to determine which course of action to take. Here we ask
          God for inspiration, an intuitive thought or a decision. We relax
          and take it easy. We don't struggle. We are often suprised how the
          right answers come after we have tried this for a while. What used
          to be the hunch or the occsasional inspiration gradually becomes a
          working part of the mind. Being still inexperienced and having just
          made contact with God, it is not probable that we are going to be
          inspired at all times. We might pay for this presumption in all sorts
          of absurd actions and ideas. Nevertheless, we find that our thinking
          will, as time passes, be more and more on the plane of inspiration.
          We come to rely on it. (1935)"</em></p>
          <p>Everything since then has been good. Everything. Life is about learning
            and growing. I got out of the Army in 1995 to work my way through college. 
            I missed the military, but the Army insisted I would be in the Infantry if I 
            re-entered the Army. After the fourth visit, jokingly, they suggested I try the 
            Navy since, "... they take anybody." Well, I tried and they did. I signed up for 
            electronics even though I was never interested before and thus began my journey
            in the Navy.</p>
          <p>I love the Navy. Despite my mouth, stubborness, and bluntness, I have done quite
            well. I attribute that to my endless energy and desire to make things better, traits
            I know come from God.</p>
            <p>I served most of the past eleven years on sea duty and am finally on an easy
              shore duty and planning my transition to the civlian community.
              I am excited for this new chapter of my life. Now that I have time, I spend a good amount of it with my family and 
              preparing for the next phase of my life. This includes learning all I always
              wanted to learn. I just achieved my Project Management Professional (PMP) - a major 
              milestone - and am learning how to code. Thus my interest in the #VetsWhoCode program.</p>
              <p>I had a great time learning the beginning of HTML and CSS. I am moving forward
                with the Javascript tutorials on Github, and also signed up with a code academy
                to gain certifications in 7 other languages. I am on my way and I look forward
                to learning in the next <strong>#VetsWhoCode</strong> Cohort.</p>
